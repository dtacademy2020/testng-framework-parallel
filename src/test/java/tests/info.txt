How to re-run failed test cases in TestNG framework?

TestNG automatically generates xml file for failed test methods
We use TestNG generated testng-failed.xml file located in test-output folder

If you want to run it through CMD after a certain xml file automatically, create a batch file (for example, script.bat) and include both mvn commands:
 E.g. 	
 		call mvn test -Drunner=loginTest.xml
		call mvn test -Drunner=test-output/testng-failed.xml


PARALLEL TESTING
 
  We can achieve parallel testing of our test suites using:
  -TestNG's built-in parallel feature in <suite> tag
  -in-house Selenium Grid
  -cloud Grid providers such as SauceLabs, BrowserStack

  In testNG we can run methods, classes and tests in parallel.
  
  
Multi-threaded program - it is a program with multiple threads running at the same time.
synchronized - keyword used with methods and blocks to make them act in synchronized manner when there are multiple threads that access that method. Synchronization makes the program slower but safer.

thread-safe -> synchronized


Data-driven testing -> data drives the test -> running the same test with different sets of data.
We do DDT in TestNG framework:
 -@DataProvider
 -Use external excel file. To read from excel we use Apache POI library.
 -Use external database and read the data from database using JDBC library.

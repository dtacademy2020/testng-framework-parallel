How to re-run failed test cases in TestNG framework?

TestNG automatically generates xml file for failed test methods
We use TestNG generated testng-failed.xml file located in test-output folder

If you want to run it through CMD after a certain xml file automatically, create a batch file (for example, script.bat) and include both mvn commands:
 E.g. 	
 		call mvn test -Drunner=loginTest.xml
		call mvn test -Drunner=test-output/testng-failed.xml


PARALLEL TESTING
 
  We can achieve parallel testing of our test suites using:
  -TestNG's built-in parallel feature in <suite> tag
  -in-house Selenium Grid
  -cloud Grid providers such as SauceLabs, BrowserStack

  In testNG we can run methods, classes and tests in parallel.
